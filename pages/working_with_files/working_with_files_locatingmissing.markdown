### Locating Files

After the project is created and files are added, there may be instances where some or all of the files are moved.  Each time ExhibitMarker&trade; opens a project it checks all the individual file paths for each PDF that is currently loaded.  If a file is not present at the recorded location, ExhibitMarker&trade; will alert the user by highlighting the file in yellow and placing exclamation points in the Status columns for the PDF.

After selecting the new location where the files are currently located, ExhibitMarker&trade; will verify that the missing files are indeed there and update the database accordingly.

If all or some of the files are not in the selected location, ExhibitMarker&trade; will notify the user how many were located.
