### Project Setup

When ExhibitMarker&trade; starts, you are prompted to open an existing project or create a new one:

![Screen Grab - Create or Open Existing Project](../../assets/user_interface_assets/UserInterface_01_Start.png)

Selecting "Create New Project" displays the Project naming window, as seen below:

 ![Screen Grab - Create New Project Options](../../assets/user_interface_assets/UserInterface_02_CreateNewProject.png)

Once you enter a name and optional matter number, you are prompted to select a save location for the project database.  

> ![Screen grab of User Interface name and ID](../../assets/user_interface_assets/UserInterface_03_NameAndID.png)

Note the location of this file, as it will be necessary to navigate the application to this directory when you open ExhibitMarker&trade; in the future to access these files.

> > ![Screen Grab - Save Location](../../assets/user_interface_assets/UserInterface_04_ProjectDatabaseSaveLocation.png)

Now the new project is ready to accept PDFs and design Stamps and Brands.
