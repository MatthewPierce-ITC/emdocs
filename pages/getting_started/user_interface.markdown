###  User Interface 

The ExhibitMarker&trade; user interface is broken up in to four major sections: [Menu bar](#menu-bar), [PDF File List](#pdf-file-list), [PDF Viewer](#pdf-viewer), and the [Editor Panels](#editor-panels).

#### __<u>Menu Bar</u>__

> #### __Project__
> ![Screen Grab - Project Menu](../../assets/user_interface_assets/UserInterface_Menu_01_Project.png)

> The Project Menu gives you options to create a new case, or open an existing case.

> The [Project Editor](../project_editor.markdown) option will open a tab that will allow you to edit the Project Name, Matter ID, and view/edit the current design files for [Stamps](../stamping/stamping.markdown), [Brands](../branding/branding.markdown), or [Exhibit ID Filters](../id_editing/id_editing_manual.markdown).

> The [Verify](../working_with_files/working_with_files_locatingmissing.markdown#verify-file-locations) and [Locate Missing](../working_with_files/working_with_files_locatingmissing.markdown#locate-missing-files) options allow you to check and modify the paths for all PDF Documents that have been loaded into the project database.

> The Clear All PDFs option will remove every document that is currently loaded into the project.  This process cannot be undone.

> #### __Import__

> ![Screen Grab - ](../../assets/user_interface_assets/UserInterface_Menu_02_Import.png)

> The Import gives you options to [import](../working_with_files/working_with_files_adding.markdown#folder-selection) PDF Documents from a single selected folder or the selected folder and all of its sub-folders.

> Additionally from this menu option, you can import new [Stamp](../stamping/stamping.markdown), [Brand](../branding/branding.markdown), or [Exhibit ID Filter](../id_editing/id_editing_manual.markdown) design files to be used with your project.

> #### __Export__

> ![Screen Grab - ](../../assets/user_interface_assets/UserInterface_Menu_03_Export.png)

> Any [Stamp](../stamping/stamping.markdown), [Brand](../branding/branding.markdown), or [Exhibit ID Filter](../id_editing/id_editing_manual.markdown) can be exported by first selecting the design file you wish to export, then clicking one of these options.  Only the design currently selected in the editor panels will be exported.

> In the [Settings](#settings) menu, you can set the marked PDFs to be saved as their original file name or the Exhibit ID.  If you need to create a set that has the opposite requirement for naming, you can use these features to save the selected PDFs in a new location with the desired name.

> #### __View__

> ![Screen Grab - View Menu](../../assets/user_interface_assets/UserInterface_Menu_04_View.png)

>  Selecting any of these options will display the corresponding Editor panel.

> #### __Stamp Editor__

> ![Screen Grab - Stamp Editor ](../../assets/user_interface_assets/UserInterface_Menu_05_StampEditor.png)

>  This is a shortcut to display the Stamp Editor panel.

> #### __Brand Editor__

> ![Screen Grab - Brand Editor](../../assets/user_interface_assets/UserInterface_Menu_06_BrandEditor.png)

 > This is a shortcut to display the Brand Editor panel.

> #### __Settings__

> ![Screen Grab - Settings](../../assets/working_with_files_assets/working_with_files_ForceOverwrite.png)

>  Each of these options can be turned on or off and display a checkmark to indicate if they are active.

>  The [Preserve Folder Structure](../working_with_files/working_with_files_destination_folder.markdown#preserve-folder-structure-option) and [Force Overwrite](../working_with_files/working_with_files_destination_folder.markdown#force-overwrite-option) are special features that impact the [Destination Folder](../working_with_files/working_with_files_destination_folder.markdown) of the marked exhibits.

> #### __Stamp Mode__

> ![Screen Grab - ](../../assets/user_interface_assets/UserInterface_Menu_08_StampMode.png)

>  This control will toggle [Stamp Mode](../stamping/stamping_process.markdown#enter-stamp-mode) on and off during the Stamping operation.

#### __<u>PDF File List</u>__

>  The PDF File List will display every PDF that is currently loaded in the project, along with status indicators to alert you to the current state of the document (Stamped, Branded, Missing, etc.).

> The column headers can be rearranged manually by dragging.  The contents can also be sorted by clicking on each.

> ![Screen Grab - PDF File List](../../assets/user_interface_assets/userInterface_11_pdfFileList.png)

#### __<u>PDF Viewer</u>__

> The PDF viewer will display the currently selected PDF in the [PDF File List](#pdf-file-list).  When a PDF is loaded, you may use any of the active buttons to navigate between pages, change the zoom level, view pages as thumbnails, and rotate or delete pages.  Hovering over the toolbar icons will bring up a tool tip that will describe each action.

#### __<u>Editor Panels</u>__

> Each of the editor panels give you the ability to modify the respective [Stamp](../stamping/stamping.markdown), [Brand](../branding/branding.markdown), or [Exhibit ID Filter](../id_editing/id_editing_manual.markdown) design files.  You can also edit the [Project](../project_editor.markdown) name and design contents.

> When not actively editing, these panels can be closed to give you more room to view and stamp the loaded documents.
