### Stamping PDF Documents

Stamping is the application of custom exhibit stickers to PDF documents.  ExhibitMarker&trade; gives you the ability to design and affix these stickers quickly and easily.

The first step is to select a Stamp Template as a base design, which you can then customize further, if needed.  Once the stamp is complete and you have loaded your documents, you can begin the stamp application process.
